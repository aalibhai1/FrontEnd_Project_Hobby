        Halo 4 marks the return of John-117 as a playable protagonist after three Halo games focusing on different sets of characters. Having been lost in space for five years after the finale of Halo 3, John-117 and Cortana, adrift aboard the wreckage of the aft section of the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn, find themselves near Requiem, the Forerunner shield world first glimpsed in the Legendary ending of Halo 3.

        The story of Halo 4 was described as being heavily focused on mystery, exploration and discovery, as well as being grand in scope and scale. Forerunner elements are featured extensively. The game also shows how humanity and the UNSC have adapted to the post-war world, particularly how they have co-opted Forerunner technology into their military devices and assets. Member species of the former Covenant return in the game, in the form of Jul 'Mdama's Covenant faction, consisting of Elites and most of their former subordinate species, including Grunts and Jackals, still loyal to the tenets of the Covenant religion. However, the Covenant remnants are taking a backseat to an entirely new antagonist, the Prometheans, an elite class of Forerunner Warriors and their legendary leader known as the Didact; this new antagonist has been described as a "threat beyond anything that Master Chief has faced before." The subject of Cortana's ongoing rampancy, a year beyond her ideal functional lifespan, is also thoroughly and prominently detailed in Halo 4.

        Unlike Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 4 was originally stated to have been designed to be part of a three-game arc from the beginning; however, the scope of the then-Reclaimer Trilogy (now known as the Reclaimer Saga) has since been expanded to encompass an undefined number of games. In addition, 343 Industries is aiming for more complete connectivity among all of their future media than that of the original trilogy; the Forerunner Saga and Kilo-Five Trilogy novels, and the Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary terminals all have connections to Halo 4's story. The third and final Forerunner Saga novel, Silentium, was released on March 19th, 2013. Frank O'Connor noted that Silentium would be released after Halo 4 for "specific strategic reasons", likely referring to the connectivity of the game and the novel. A live action series, Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn, provides a backstory for Thomas Lasky, a major character in the game; this series consists of five episodes totaling 75 minutes. The Halo 4 Collector's Edition includes a 90 minute extended cut of the series.
